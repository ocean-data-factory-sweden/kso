# List of members which are set dynamically and missed by pylint inference
# system, and so shouldn't trigger E1101 (no-member) when accessed. Python regular
# expressions are accepted. 
# Normally one would do this in MAIN with extension-pkg-whitelist=cv2, but this did not work
# See: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/error/no-member.html

# For now we only want to see the errors (F and E), next step would be to turn on W
